##### Problem Statement ID::	MA1217  
##### Problem Statement Title::	Block chain application for tagging farm produces  
##### Description::  
"Block chain application and traceability benefits are reaped only by &e organised food retails and branded corporates. The transparency in agricultural production system and assurance on raw material quality for food industry are not assurcd and no system to validate on a real time basis. A customized Block Chain for traceability of farm produce will enable trust on the quality and better price for farmers by labels integratcd with barcodes and trackinB systems"

### Submitted Idea:: [PDF](https://sih.gov.in/uploads/template/SMARTINDIAHACKATHON202220220515204519.pdf)  
**Summarising the solution idea::**  
* Hardware device for scanning barcodes/IDs
    *  mapped with farmers, scanned by Food Industry(for quality assurance),
    *  mapped with Food Industry, scanned by farmers(for pricing).  
* Customized Blockchain for traceability of farm produce and prices **using Hyperledger Fabric and Amazon Managed Blockchain**
* Enabling trust on the quality assurance **using endorsement in form of rating by food industry**, implementation should be done in application.
* The same Hardware device for showing outputs
    * The ratings of farm produce,
    * Price for farmers,
    * Output should be integer and string type, 4 or 5 values according to hardware device scrren size.
