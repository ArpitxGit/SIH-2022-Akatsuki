# SIH-2022-Akatsuki
Qualified For Grand Finale

**Congratulations for being “SHORTLISTED” for the Grand Finale of Smart India Hackathon 2022.**  

##### Problem Statement ID::	MA1217  
##### Problem Statement Title::	Block chain application for tagging farm produces  
##### Description::  
"Block chain application and traceability benefits are reaped only by &e organised food retails and branded corporates. The transparency in agricultural production system and assurance on raw material quality for food industry are not assurcd and no system to validate on a real time basis. A customized Block Chain for traceability of farm produce will enable trust on the quality and better price for farmers by labels integratcd with barcodes and trackinB systems"  
##### Category:: Hardware  
##### Technology Bucket::	Blockchain & Cybersecurity  
##### Organization:: 	NIFTEM Thanjavur ,Ministry of Food Processing Industries (MoFPI)  

### Submitted Idea:: [PDF](https://sih.gov.in/uploads/template/SMARTINDIAHACKATHON202220220515204519.pdf)  

### Submission in Round 2::![Round2Submission](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75042859/182963478-f583a721-330c-4ff6-96f9-5d423b8c632b.png)

**Summarising the solution idea::**  
* Hardware devices: Sensors for ex: RFID,EPCIS, Barcodes 
    * Measures different parameters for different farm produces
    * Temperature, Relative Humidity, PH, Color, etc depends on type of farm produce
* Customized **Blockchain** for traceability of farm produce and prices
    * Should be cost-effective and eco-friendly
    * Different categories of farm produces with different numbers of intermediatories should be implemented in smart contract
    * Issue raiser should be implemented on blockchain for tamperproof data.
    * Overall Background of all types of Farm Produce.
* Enabling trust on the quality assurance **using endorsement in form of rating by food industry**, implementation should be done in application. 

#### Work to be done::
* Sampriti Patel: Categorise different types of farm produces.
* Kanishk Vats: Find out the number of parties involved in different kind of farm produces.
* Mohit Bakshi, Priyam Raj, N Tun Sian Zai: Work on Hardware device and map different parameters that needs to be measured for different farm produces.
* Arpit Kumar: Figure out and optimise the number of transactions that will be made in the whole process and by whom.
